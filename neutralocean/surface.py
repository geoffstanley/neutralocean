    """Calculate a potential density (or specific volume) surface.

    Given practical / Absolute salinity `S`, potential / Conservative
    temperature `T`, and pressure (when non-Boussinesq) or depth
    (when Boussinesq) `P`, and given a reference pressure / depth `ref`,
    calculate an isosurface of `eos(S, T, ref)` where `eos` is the equation
    of state.

    Parameters
    ----------
    S, T : ndarray or xarray.DataArray

        3D practical / Absolute salinity and potential / Conservative
        temperature --- that is, a 2D array of 1D water columns or "casts"

    P : ndarray or xarray.DataArray

        In the non-Boussinesq case, `P` is the 3D pressure, sharing the same
        dimensions as `S` and `T`.

        In the Boussinesq case, `P` is the depth and can be 3D with the same
        structure as `S` and `T`, or can be 1D with as many elements as there
        are in the vertical dimension of `S` and `T`.

    ref : float

        The reference pressure or depth, in the same units as `P`.

        If `ref` is None, the reference value is taken as `pin_p`.

        See Examples section.

    isoval : float

        Isovalue of the potential density surface.
        Units are same as returned by `eos`.

        See Examples section.

    pin_p : float

        Pressure or depth at which the surface intersects the cast `pin_cast`.

        See Examples section.

    pin_cast : tuple or list of int of length 2

        Index for cast where surface is at pressure or depth `pin_p`.

        See Examples section.

    Returns
    -------
    s, t, p : ndarray or xarray.DataArray

        practical / Absolute salinity, potential / Conservative temperature,
        and pressure / depth on the surface

    d : dict

        Diagnostics.

        `"e_MAV"` : float

            Mean Absolute Value of the Ïµ neutrality error on the surface,
            area-weighted.  Units are those of `eos` return values divided by
            those of `dist*` inputs.

        `"e_RMS"` : float

            As `"e_MAV"` but for the Root Mean Square.

        `"n_wet"`: float

            Number of wet casts (surface points).

        `"timer"` : float

            Time spent on the whole algorithm, excluding set-up and diagnostics.

        `"ref"` : float

            Reference pressure / depth for surface (matching input `ref` if given,
            otherwise this is calculated internally).

        `"isoval"` : float

            Isovalue of potential density for surface (matching input `isoval`
            if given, otherwise this is calculated internally).

    Other Parameters
    ----------------
    grid : dict
        Containing the following:

        edges : tuple of length 2
            Each element is an array of int of length E, where E is the number of
            edges in the grid's graph, i.e. the number of pairs of adjacent water
            columns (including land) in the grid.
            If `edges = (a, b)`, the nodes (water columns) whose linear indices are
            `a[i]` and `b[i]` are adjacent.
            Required if `diags` is True

        dist : 1d array
            Horizontal distance between adjacent water columns (nodes).
            `dist[i]` is the distance between nodes whose linear indices are
            `edges[0][i]` and `edges[1][i]`.
            If absent, a value of 1.0 is assumed for all edges.

        distperp : 1d array
            Horizontal distance of the face between adjacent water columns (nodes).
            `distperp[i]` is the distance of the interface between nodes whose
            linear indices are `edges[0][i]` and `edges[1][i]`.
            If absent, a value of 1.0 is assumed for all edges.

        For a rectilinear grid (e.g. latitude-longitude), use
            `neutralocean.grid.rectilinear.build_grid`

        For a tiled rectilinear grid, such as works with XGCM, use
            `neutralocean.grid.xgcm.build_grid`

        For a general grid given as a graph, use
            `neutralocean.grid.graph.build_grid`

        Also see the examples in `neutralocean.examples`.

    vert_dim : int or str, Default -1

        Specifies which dimension of `S`, `T` (and `P` if 3D) is vertical.

        If `S` and `T` are `ndarray`, then `vert_dim` is the `int` indexing
        the vertical dimension of `S` and `T` (e.g. -1 indexes the last
        dimension).

        If `S` and `T` are `xarray.DataArray`, then `vert_dim` is a `str`
        naming the vertical dimension of `S` and `T`.

        Ideally, `vert_dim` is -1.  See `Notes`.

    eos : function, Default `neutralocean.eos.gsw.specvol`

        Function taking three inputs corresponding to (`S, T, P)`, and
        outputting the in-situ density or specific volume.
        Should be `@numba.njit` decorated and need not be vectorized.

    eos_s_t : function, `neutralocean.eos.gsw.specvol_s_t`

        Function taking three inputs corresponding to (`S, T, P)`, and
        outputting a tuple containing the partial derivatives of the equation of
        state with respect to `S` and `T`.
        Should be `@numba.njit` decorated and need not be vectorized.
        Note: This is only used when `diags` is `True`.

    interp : str, Default 'linear'

        Method for vertical interpolation.  Use `'linear'` for linear
        interpolation, and `'pchip'` for Piecewise Cubic Hermite Interpolating
        Polynomials.  Other interpolants can be added through the subpackage,
        `ppinterp`.

    diags : bool, Default True

        If True, calculate diagnostics (4th output).  If False, 4th output is
        an empty dict.

    output : bool, Default True

        If `True`, prints diagnostic output during computation.
        `diags` must be `True` for this to have any effect.
        To redirect this output to a file, do the following
        >>> import sys
        >>> tmp = sys.stdout
        >>> sys.stdout = file_id = open('myfile.txt', 'w')
        >>> # Now call this function ...
        >>> sys.stdout = tmp
        >>> file_id.close()

    TOL_P_SOLVER : float, Default 1e-4

        Error tolerance when root-finding to update the pressure or depth of
        the surface in each water column. Units are the same as `P`.

    Examples
    --------
    The output surface must be specified by some combination of reference
    pressure / depth `ref`, isovalue `isoval`, pinning cast `pin_cast` and
    pinning pressure `pin_p`.  The following methods are valid, and listed in
    order of precedence (e.g. `pin_cast` and `pin_p` are not used if both
    `ref` and `isoval` are given).

    >>> potential_surf(S, T, P, ref=___, isoval=___, ...)

    This finds the surface with given reference pressure / depth and the given
    isovalue.

    >>> potential_surf(S, T, P, ref=___, pin_p=___, pin_cast=___, ...)

    This finds the surface with given reference pressure / depth that intersects
    the given cast at the given pressure or depth.

    >>> potential_surf(S, T, P, pin_p=___, pin_cast=___, ...)

    This is as for the previous method, but selects the reference pressure /
    depth as `pin_p` (i.e. the local `P` value at the given cast's given
    pressure or depth).

    Notes
    -----
    This code will internally re-arrange `S`, `T`, `P` to have the vertical
    dimension last, so that the data for an individual water column is
    contiguous in memory.  If you call this function many times, consider
    using `lib._process_casts` to pre-process your `S`, `T`, `P` inputs to
    have the vertical dimension last.

            Mean Absolute Value of the pressure or depth change from one
            iteration to the next

        `"Îp_RMS"` : array of float

            Root Mean Square of the pressure or depth change from one
            iteration to the next

        `"Îp_Linf"` : array of float

            Maximum absolute value (infinity norm) of the pressure or depth
            change from one iteration to the next

        `"n_newly_wet"` : array of int

            Number of casts that are newly wet, per iteration

        `"timer_bfs"` : array of float

            Time spent in Breadth-First Search including wetting, per iteration.

    Other Parameters
    ----------------
    grid, vert_dim, interp, eos, eos_s_t, diags, output, TOL_P_SOLVER :

        See `potential_surf`
        Note: `eos_s_t` is required.

    ITER_MIN : int, Default 1

        Minimum number of iterations.

    ITER_MAX : int, Default 10

        Maximum number of iterations.

    ITER_START_WETTING : int, Default 1

        Iteration on which wetting begins.  Set to `np.inf` (`ITER_MAX` + 1
        would also do) to deactivate.

    ITER_STOP_WETTING : int, Default 5

        The last iteration on which to perform wetting.  This can be useful to
        avoid pesky water columns that repeatedly wet then dry.

    TOL_LRPD_MAV : float, Default 1e-7

        Exit iterations when the mean absolute value of the Locally Referenced
        Potential Density perturbation that updates the surface from one
        iteration to the next is less than this value.  Units are [kg m-3],
        even if `eos` returns a specific volume.  Set to 0 to deactivate.

    TOL_P_CHANGE_RMS : float, Default 0.0

        Exit iterations when the root mean square of the pressure or depth
        change on the surface from one iteration to the next is less than this
        value. Set to 0 to deactivate. Units are the same as `P` [dbar or m].

    p_ml : ndarray or dict, Default None

        If a dict, the pressure or depth at the base of the mixed layer is
        computed using `mld` with p_ml passed as keyword arguments,
        enabling control over the parameters in that function.
        See `mld` for details.

        If an ndarray (of the same shape as the lateral dimensions of `S`),
        the pressure or depth at the base of the mixed layer in each water
        column.

        When the surface's pressure is shallower than `p_ml` in any water
        column, it is set to NaN (a "dry" water column). This is not applied
        to the initial surface, but only to the surface after the first
        iteration, as the initial surface could be very far from neutral.

        If None, the mixed layer is not removed.

    OMEGA_FORMULATION : str, Default 'poisson'

        Specify how the matrix problem is set up and solved.  Options are
            - `'poisson'`, to solve the Poisson problem as in [1]_ with Cholesky, or
            - `'gradient'`, to solve the overdetermined gradient equations as in [2]_
              using LSQR.
