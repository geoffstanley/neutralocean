        initial guess for a root
    A, B : float

    Find a zero of a univariate function within a given range

    This is a bracketed root-finding method, so `f(a)` and `f(b)` must differ in
    sign. If they do, a root is guaranteed to be found.

    Parameters
    ----------
    f : function
        Continuous function of a single variable.
    a, b : float
        Range within which to search, satisfying `a < b` and ideally `f(a) * f(b) <= 0`
    t : float
        Tolerance for convergence.
    args : tuple
        Additional arguments, beyond the optimization argument, to be passed to `f`.

    Returns
    -------
    float
        Value of `x` where `f(x) ~ 0`.

    Notes
    -----
    `f` should be a `@numba.njit`'ed function (when this function is `njit`'ed).
