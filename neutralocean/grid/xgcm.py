def build_grid(

):
    """
    Make a list of edges between adjacent nodes in a graph consisting of
    rectilinear tiles, with adjacency between tiles specified as for xgcm;
    also generate lists of distances associated with these edges.

    Here, the grid is thought of as a graph, where each node represents a
    water column, and the graph has an edge between two nodes when the
    corresponding water columns are adjacent in physical space.


    Parameters
    ----------
    n : int
        Number of grid points on each side of a square tile.
        (Note xgcm only handles square tiles.)

    face_connections : dict
        xgcm-style specification for how tiles (faces) are connected.
        See https://xgcm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/grid_topology.html

    dims : tuple of str
        A tuple of length 3, with one entry being the same as the only key in
        the `face_connections` dict, and the other two being 'i' and 'j'.

        This names, in order, the dimensions of a DataArray whose data lives
        on each (tracer) grid point in the horizontal, and has no vertical
        dimension.

        If `D` is a DataArray giving the Sea Surface Temperature, for example,
        then this argument should be `D.dims`.

        Example: in ECCOv4r4, `dims == ('tile', 'j', 'i')`.

    xsh : str
        The direction of shifting in the 'i' dimension.  Can be either "left"
        or "right".

        If "left", then `dxC` is the distance between the local grid point (i, j)
        and the previous grid point in the 'i' dimension, at (i-1, j).

        If "right", then `dxC` is the distance between the local grid point (i, j)
        and the next grid point in the 'i' dimension, at (i+1, j).

    ysh : str
        The direction of shifting in the 'j' dimension.  Can be either "left"
        or "right".

        If "left", then `dyC` is the distance between the local grid point (i, j)
        and the previous grid point in the 'j' dimension, at (i, j+1).

        If "right", then `dyC` is the distance between the local grid point (i, j)
        and the next grid point in the 'j' dimension, at (i, j+1).

    dxC : float or ndarray, Default 1.0
        Distance between adjacent grid points in the 'i' dimension.

    dyC : float or ndarray, Default 1.0
        Distance between adjacent grid points in the 'j' dimension

    dxG : float or ndarray, Default 1.0
        Distance of the face between adjacent grid points in the 'j' dimension

    dyG : float or ndarray, Default 1.0
        Distance of the face between adjacent grid points in the 'i' dimension


    Returns
    -------
    grid : dict
        Containing the following:

        edges : tuple of length 2
            Each element is an array of int of length E, where E is the number of
            edges in the grid's graph, i.e. the number of pairs of adjacent water
            columns (including land) in the grid.
            If `edges = (a, b)`, the nodes (water columns) whose linear indices are
            `a[i]` and `b[i]` are adjacent.

        dist : 1d array
            Horizontal distance between adjacent water columns (nodes).
            `dist[i]` is the distance between nodes whose linear indices are
            `edges[0][i]` and `edges[1][i]`.

        distperp : 1d array
            Horizontal distance of the face between adjacent water columns (nodes).
            `distperp[i]` is the distance of the interface between nodes whose
            linear indices are `edges[0][i]` and `edges[1][i]`.
