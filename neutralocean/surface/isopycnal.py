    """Calculate a potential density (or specific volume) surface.

    Given practical / Absolute salinity `S`, potential / Conservative
    temperature `T`, and pressure (when non-Boussinesq) or depth
    (when Boussinesq) `P`, and given a reference pressure / depth `ref`,
    calculate an isosurface of `eos(S, T, ref)` where `eos` is the equation
    of state.

    Parameters
    ----------
    S, T : ndarray or xarray.DataArray

        3D practical / Absolute salinity and potential / Conservative
        temperature --- that is, a 2D array of 1D water columns or "casts"

    P : ndarray or xarray.DataArray

        In the non-Boussinesq case, `P` is the 3D pressure, sharing the same
        dimensions as `S` and `T`.

        In the Boussinesq case, `P` is the depth and can be 3D with the same
        structure as `S` and `T`, or can be 1D with as many elements as there
        are in the vertical dimension of `S` and `T`.

    ref : float

        The reference pressure or depth, in the same units as P.

        If `ref` is None, the reference value is taken as `pin_p`.

        See Examples section.

    isoval : float

        Isovalue of the potential density surface.
        Units are same as returned by `eos`.

        See Examples section.

    pin_p : float

        Pressure or depth at which the surface intersects the cast `pin_cast`.

        See Examples section.

    pin_cast : tuple or list of int of length 2

        Index for cast where surface is at pressure or depth `pin_p`.

        See Examples section.

    Returns
    -------
    s, t, p : ndarray or xarray.DataArray

        practical / Absolute salinity, potential / Conservative temperature,
        and pressure / depth on the surface

    d : dict

        Diagnostics.

        `"e_MAV"` : float

            Mean Absolute Value of the Ïµ neutrality error on the surface,
            area-weighted.  Units are those of `eos` return values divided by
            those of `dist*` inputs.

        `"e_RMS"` : float

            As `"e_MAV"` but for the Root Mean Square.

        `"n_wet"`: float

            Number of wet casts (surface points).

        `"timer"` : float

            Time spent on the whole algorithm, excluding set-up and diagnostics.

        `"ref"` : float

            Reference pressure / depth for surface (matching input `ref` if given,
            otherwise this is calculated internally).

        `"isoval"` : float

            Isovalue of potential density for surface (matching input `ref` if
            given, otherwise this is calculated internally).

    Other Parameters
    ----------------
    grid : dict
        Containing the following:

        edges : tuple of length 2
            Each element is an array of int of length E, where E is the number of
            edges in the grid's graph, i.e. the number of pairs of adjacent water
            columns (including land) in the grid.
            If `edges = (a, b)`, the nodes (water columns) whose linear indices are
            `a[i]` and `b[i]` are adjacent.
            Required if `diags` is True

        dist : 1d array
            Horizontal distance between adjacent water columns (nodes).
            `dist[i]` is the distance between nodes whose linear indices are
            `edges[0][i]` and `edges[1][i]`.
            If absent, a value of 1.0 is assumed for all edges.

        distperp : 1d array
            Horizontal distance of the face between adjacent water columns (nodes).
            `distperp[i]` is the distance of the interface between nodes whose
            linear indices are `edges[0][i]` and `edges[1][i]`.
            If absent, a value of 1.0 is assumed for all edges.

        For a rectilinear grid (e.g. latitude-longitude), use
            `neutralocean.grid.rectilinear.build_grid`

        For a tiled rectilinear grid, such as works with XGCM, use
            `neutralocean.grid.xgcm.build_grid`

        For a general grid given as a graph, use
            `neutralocean.grid.graph.build_grid`

        Also see the examples in `neutralocean.examples`.

    vert_dim : int or str, Default -1

        Specifies which dimension of `S`, `T` (and `P` if 3D) is vertical.

        If `S` and `T` are `ndarray`, then `vert_dim` is the `int` indexing
        the vertical dimension of `S` and `T` (e.g. -1 indexes the last
        dimension).

        If `S` and `T` are `xarray.DataArray`, then `vert_dim` is a `str`
        naming the vertical dimension of `S` and `T`.

        Ideally, `vert_dim` is -1.  See `Notes`.

    eos : str or function or tuple of functions, Default 'gsw'

        Specification for the equation of state.

        If a str, can be any of the strings accepted by
        `neutralocean.eos.tools.make_eos`,
        e.g. `'jmd95'`, `'jmdfwg06'`, `'gsw'`.

        If a function, must take three inputs corresponding to `S`, `T`, and
        `P`, and output the density (or specific volume).  This form is not
        allowed when `diags` is `True`.  This can be made as, e.g.,
        `eos = neutralocean.eos.make_eos('gsw')`
        for a non-Boussinesq ocean, or as
        `eos = neutralocean.eos.make_eos('gsw', grav, rho_c)`
        for a Boussinesq ocean with `grav` and `rho_c` (see inputs below).

        If a tuple of functions, the first element must be a function for the
        equation of state as above, and the second element must be a function
        taking the same three inputs as above and returning two outputs, namely
        the partial derivatives of the equation of state with respect to `S`
        and `T`.  The second element can be made as, e.g.,
        `eos_s_t = neutralocean.eos.make_eos_s_t('gsw', grav, rho_c)`

        The function (or the first element of the tuple of functions) should be
        `@numba.njit` decorated and need not be vectorized -- it will be called
        many times with scalar inputs.

    grav : float, Default None
        Gravitational acceleration [m s-2].  When non-Boussinesq, pass `None`.

    rho_c : float, Default None
        Boussinesq reference density [kg m-3].  When non-Boussinesq, pass `None`.

    interp : str, Default 'linear'

        Method for vertical interpolation.  Use `'linear'` for linear
        interpolation, and `'pchip'` for Piecewise Cubic Hermite Interpolating
        Polynomials.  Other interpolants can be added through the subpackage,
        `ppinterp`.

    n_good : ndarray, Default None

        Pre-computed number of ocean data points in each water column.
        If None, this is computed as `n_good = lib.find_first_nan(S)`.

    diags : bool, Default True

        If True, calculate diagnostics (4th output).  If False, 4th output is
        an empty dict.

    output : bool, Default True

        If `True`, prints diagnostic output during computation.
        `diags` must be `True` for this to have any effect.
        To redirect this output to a file, do the following
        >>> import sys
        >>> tmp = sys.stdout
        >>> sys.stdout = file_id = open('myfile.txt', 'w')
        >>> # Now call this function ...
        >>> sys.stdout = tmp
        >>> file_id.close()

    TOL_P_SOLVER : float, Default 1e-4

        Error tolerance when root-finding to update the pressure or depth of
        the surface in each water column. Units are the same as `P`.

    Examples
    --------
    The output surface must be specified by some combination of reference
    pressure / depth `ref`, isovalue `isoval`, pinning cast `pin_cast` and
    pinning pressure `pin_p`.  The following methods are valid, and listed in
    order of precedence (e.g. `pin_cast` and `pin_p` are not used if both
    `ref` and `isoval` are given).

    >>> potential_surf(S, T, P, ref=___, isoval=___, ...)

    This finds the surface with given reference pressure / depth and the given
    isovalue.

    >>> potential_surf(S, T, P, ref=___, pin_p=___, pin_cast=___, ...)

    This finds the surface with given reference pressure / depth that intersects
    the given cast at the given pressure or depth.

    >>> potential_surf(S, T, P, pin_p=___, pin_cast=___, ...)

    This is as for the previous method, but selects the reference pressure /
    depth as `pin_p` (i.e. the local `P` value at the given cast's given
    pressure or depth).

    Notes
    -----
    This code will internally re-arrange `S`, `T`, `P` to have the vertical
    dimension last, so that the data for an individual water column is
    contiguous in memory.  If you call this function many times, consider
    using `lib._process_casts` to pre-process your `S`, `T`, `P` inputs to
    have the vertical dimension last.
