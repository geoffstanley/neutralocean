def omega_surf(S, T, P, grid, **kwargs):
    """Calculate an omega surface from structured ocean data.

    Given 3D salinity, temperature, and pressure or depth data arranged on a
    rectilinear grid, calculate a 2D omega surface [1]_ [2]_, which is a
    highly accurate approximately neutral surface.

    Parameters
    ----------
    S, T, P : ndarray or xarray.DataArray

        See `potential_surf`

    p_init : ndarray, Default None

        Pressure or depth on the initial approximately neutral surface.

        See Examples section.

    ref : float, or tuple of float of length 2

        If `p_init` is None, the reference value(s) for the initial potential
        density surface or in-situ density (specific volume) anomaly surface
        that initializes the omega surface algorithm. If `ref` is a scalar, a
        potential density urface is used, and if `ref` is None, the reference
        `P` is `pin_p` (i.e. taken local to the pinning location). If `ref`
        is a tuple of length two, a in-situ density anomaly surface is used,
        and if `ref` is (None, None), then the reference `S` and `T` values
        are taken local to the pinning location (pressure or depth `pin_p` on
        the pinning cast `pin_cast`).

        See Examples section.

    isoval : float

        Isovalue for the initial potential density or in-situ density anomaly
        surface when `p_init` is not given.  Units are same as returned by
        the function specified by `eos`.

        See Examples section.

    pin_p, pin_cast :

        See `potential_surf`

    Returns
    -------
    s, t, p : ndarray or xarray.DataArray

        practical / Absolute salinity, potential / Conservative temperature,
        and pressure / depth on surface

    d : dict

        Diagnostics.
        The first four listed below give information going into the `i`'th
        iteration (e.g. the 0'th element is about the initial surface).
        The rest give information about what the `i`'th iteration did (and
        hence their 0'th elements are irrelevant).

        `"e_MAV"` : array of float

            Mean Absolute Value of the ϵ neutrality error on the surface,
            area-weighted.  Units are those of `eos` return values divided by
            those of `dist*` inputs.

        `"e_RMS"` : array of float

            As `"e_MAV"` but for the Root Mean Square.

        `"n_wet"`: array of float

            Number of wet casts (surface points).

        `"timer"` : array of float

            Time spent on each iteration, excluding set-up (approximately) and diagnostics.

        `"ϕ_MAV"` : array of float

            Mean Absolute Value of the Locally Referenced Potential Density
            perturbation, per iteration

        `"Δp_MAV"` : array of float

            Mean Absolute Value of the pressure or depth change from one
            iteration to the next

        `"Δp_RMS"` : array of float

            Root Mean Square of the pressure or depth change from one
            iteration to the next

        `"Δp_Linf"` : array of float

            Maximum absolute value (infinity norm) of the pressure or depth
            change from one iteration to the next

        `"n_newly_wet"` : array of int

            Number of casts that are newly wet, per iteration

        `"timer_bfs"` : array of float

            Time spent in Breadth-First Search including wetting, per iteration.

        `"timer_mat"` : array of float

            Time spent building and solving the matrix problem, per iteration.

        `"timer_update"` : array of float

            Time spent vertically updating the surface.

    Other Parameters
    ----------------
    grid, vert_dim, grav, rho_c, interp, n_good, diags, output, TOL_P_SOLVER :

        See `potential_surf`

    eos : str or tuple of functions, Default 'gsw'

        As in `potential_surf`, excluding the option to pass a single function.
        The omega surface algorithm relies on knowing the partial derivatives
        of the equation of state with respect to salinity and temperature, so
        the `eos_s_t` function is also required if given as a tuple of functions.

    ITER_MIN : int, Default 1

        Minimum number of iterations.

    ITER_MAX : int, Default 10

        Maximum number of iterations.

    ITER_START_WETTING : int, Default 1

        Iteration on which wetting begins.  Set to `np.inf` (`ITER_MAX` + 1
        would also do) to deactivate.

    ITER_STOP_WETTING : int, Default 5

        The last iteration on which to perform wetting.  This can be useful to
        avoid pesky water columns that repeatedly wet then dry.

    TOL_LRPD_MAV : float, Default 1e-7

        Exit iterations when the mean absolute value of the Locally Referenced
        Potential Density perturbation that updates the surface from one
        iteration to the next is less than this value.  Units are [kg m-3],
        even if `eos` returns a specific volume.  Set to 0 to deactivate.

    TOL_P_CHANGE_RMS : float, Default 0.0

        Exit iterations when the root mean square of the pressure or depth
        change on the surface from one iteration to the next is less than this
        value. Set to 0 to deactivate. Units are the same as `P` [dbar or m].

    p_ml : ndarray or dict, Default None

        If a dict, the pressure or depth at the base of the mixed layer is
        computed using `mixed_layer` with p_ml passed as keyword arguments,
        enabling control over the parameters in that function.
        See `mixed_layer` for details.

        If an ndarray (of the same shape as the lateral dimensions of `S`),
        the pressure or depth at the base of the mixed layer in each water
        column.

        When the surface's pressure is shallower than `p_ml` in any water
        column, it is set to NaN (a "dry" water column). This is not applied
        to the initial surface, but only to the surface after the first
        iteration, as the initial surface could be very far from neutral.

        If None, the mixed layer is not removed.

    OMEGA_FORMULATION : str, Default 'poisson'

        Specify how the matrix problem is set up and solved.  Options are
            - `'poisson'`, to solve the Poisson problem as in [1]_ with Cholesky, or
            - `'gradient'`, to solve the overdetermined gradient equations as in [2]_
              using LSQR.

    Examples
    --------
    omega surfaces require a pinning cast and initial surface.  The surface is
    iteratively updated while remaining fixed at the pinning cast.  The
    initial surface can be provided directly, as the surface with pressure or
    depth given by `p_init`, in the following method:

    >>> omega_surf(S, T, P, pin_cast, p_init, ...)

    Alternatively, a potential density surface or an in-situ density (specific
    volume) anomaly surface can be used as the initial surface.  To do this,
    use one of the following two methods:

    >>> omega_surf(S, T, P, ref, isoval, pin_cast, ...)

    >>> omega_surf(S, T, P, ref, pin_p, pin_cast, ...)

    For more info on these methods, see the Examples section of `potential_surf`.
    Note that `pin_cast` is always a required input.  Note that `ref` is
    needed to distinguish which of the two types of isopycnals will be used as
    the initial surface.
