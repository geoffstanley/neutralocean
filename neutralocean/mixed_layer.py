    """Calculate the pressure or depth at the bottom of the mixed layer

    The mixed layer is the pressure or depth at which the potential density
    (referenced to `ref_p`) exceeds the potential density near the surface
    (specifically, the bottle indexed by `bottle_index` on each cast) by an
    amount of `pot_dens_diff`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    S, T : ndarray or xarray.DataArray

        3D practical / Absolute salinity and potential / Conservative
        temperature --- that is, a 2D array of 1D water columns or "casts"

    P : ndarray or xarray.DataArray

        In the non-Boussinesq case, `P` is the 3D pressure, sharing the same
        dimensions as `S` and `T`.

        In the Boussinesq case, `P` is the depth and can be 3D with the same
        structure as `S` and `T`, or can be 1D with as many elements as there
        are in the vertical dimension of `S` and `T`.

        Must increase monotonically along the first dimension (i.e. downwards).

    eos : str or function, Default 'gsw'

        Specification for the equation of state.

        If a str, can be any of the strings accepted by
        `neutralocean.eos.tools.make_eos`,
        e.g. `'jmd95'`, `'jmdfwg06'`, `'gsw'`.

        If a function, must take three inputs corresponding to `S`, `T`, and
        `P`, and output the density (or specific volume).  This form is not
        allowed when `diags` is `True`.  This can be made as, e.g.,
        `eos = neutralocean.eos.make_eos('gsw')`
        for a non-Boussinesq ocean, or as
        `eos = neutralocean.eos.make_eos('gsw', grav, rho_c)`
        for a Boussinesq ocean with `grav` and `rho_c` (see inputs below).

        The function should be `@numba.njit` decorated and need not be vectorized
        -- it will be called many times with scalar inputs.

    grav : float, Default None
        Gravitational acceleration [m s-2].  When non-Boussinesq, pass `None`.

    rho_c : float, Default None
        Boussinesq reference density [kg m-3].  When non-Boussinesq, pass `None`.

    pot_dens_diff : float, Default 0.03

        Difference in potential density [kg m-3] between the near-surface and
        the base of the mixed layer.

    ref_p : float, Default 100.0

        Reference pressure or depth for potential density [dbar or m].

    bottle_index : int, Default 1

        The index for the bottle on each cast where the "near surface" potential
        density is calculated.  Note this index is 0-based.  The Default of 1
        therefore indexes the second bottle in each cast.

    interp : str, Default 'linear'

        Method for vertical interpolation.  Use `'linear'` for linear
        interpolation, and `'pchip'` for Piecewise Cubic Hermite Interpolating
        Polynomials.  Other interpolants can be added through the subpackage,
        `interp1d`.

    vert_dim : int or str, Default -1

        Specifies which dimension of `S`, `T` (and `P` if 3D) is vertical.

        If `S` and `T` are `ndarray`, then `vert_dim` is the `int` indexing
        the vertical dimension of `S` and `T` (e.g. -1 indexes the last
        dimension).

        If `S` and `T` are `xarray.DataArray`, then `vert_dim` is a `str`
        naming the vertical dimension of `S` and `T`.

        Ideally, `vert_dim` is -1.  See `Notes` section of `potential_surf`.


    Returns
    -------
    ML : ndarray

        A 2D array giving the pressure [dbar] or depth [m, positive] of the mixed layer
