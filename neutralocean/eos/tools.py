    """Make an equation of state function, possibly modified for Boussinesq

    Parameters
    ----------
    eos : str or function

        If a str, can be 'gsw' to generate the TEOS-10 specific volume [1]_,
        'jmd95' to generate the Jackett and McDougall (1995) in-situ
        density [2]_, or 'jmdfwg06' to generate the Jackett et al (2006)
        in-situ density [3]_.

        If a function, should be an equation of state as a function of
        practical / Absolute salinity, potential / Conservative temperature,
        and pressure (for non-Boussesinq) / depth (for Boussinesq).

    grav, rho_c : float

        Gravitational acceleration [m s-2] and Boussinesq reference density
        [kg m-3]. If both are provided, the equation of state is modified as
        appropriate for the Boussinesq approximation, in which the third
        argument is depth, not pressure. Specifically, a depth `z` is
        converted to `1e-4 * grav * rho_c * z`, which is the hydrostatic
        pressure [dbar] at depth `z` [m] caused by a water column of density
        `rho_c` under gravity `grav`.

    Returns
    -------
    eos : function

        The desired equation of state.
